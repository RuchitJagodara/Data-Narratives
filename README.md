# Data-Narratives

This repo contains few data narratives including their reports and codes to generate the results.

# Overview
Developed as part of the ES-114 course at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, this narrative exemplifies the practical integration of Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization. Created during April '23, this project aligns with the ES-113 Data Centric Computing course, enriching our exploration of the Tennis Major Tournaments dataset.

Through the lenses of Clustering, Classification, and Regression, I have unearthed insights utilizing tools like Covariance Matrices, Correlation Factors, and Principal Components Analysis. My data-driven journey underscores the synergy between Python libraries and statistical concepts.

Explore the code, datasets, and final report in this repository. Join me in advancing data science insights and their real-world applications.
