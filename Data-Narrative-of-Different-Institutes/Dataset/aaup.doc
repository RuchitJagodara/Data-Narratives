This dataset contains information on faculty salaries
for 1161 American colleges and universities.  The data may be
obtained in either of two formats.

AAUP.DATA contains the raw data in comma delimited fields with a
single data line for each school. The order of variables is the
same as given below for the fixed column version, although the
spacing varies for each school.

AAUP2.DATA has the data arranged in fixed columns, with two data
lines for each school and a maximum line length of 80 characters.

This dataset is taken from the March-April 1994 issue of Academe.
Thanks to Maryse Eymonerie, Consultant to AAUP, for assistance in
supplying the data.  Faculty salary data are for the 1993-94
school year. You may wish to consult a copy of the special issue
of Academe for more detailed descriptions of the variables.
